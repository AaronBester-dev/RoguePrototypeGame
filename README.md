Statement: I did all of the work for this assignment by myself and no external help was used besides TA's, the professor, and JavaDocs. 
Execution Instructions: Simply use gradle build to compile it and use java -jar build/libs/A3.jar to execute the program. 
Control schemes: 
S/Arrow Key Up = Up 
Z/Arrow Key Left = Left 
X/Arrow Key Down = Down 
C/Arrow Key Right = Right 
Specific differences: If no rooms are in the roomArray or there is only one room after running verifyRoom() on all rooms the program will exit and say the file can not be used.

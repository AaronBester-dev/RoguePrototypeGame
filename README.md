Statement: I did all of the work for this assignment by myself and no external help was used besides TA's, the professor, and JavaDocs. 
Execution Instructions: Simply use gradle build to compile it and use java -jar build/libs/A2.jar to execute the program. 
Alternate control scheme: 
W/Arrow Key Up = Up 
A/Arrow Key Left = Left 
S/Arrow Key Down = Down 
D/Arrow Key Right = Right 
Specific differences: For verifyRooms() if the room that was removed from the roomArray was the room the player was supposed to start in
then I made it so the next available room was the room to start in. If there are no available rooms the program will stop and say
the dungeon file can't be used. If no rooms are in the roomArray or there is only one room then the program will also stop and say the dungeon file can't be used.
